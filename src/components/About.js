            <p>
                Coming from a background in Public Safety and Security, I've spent the last 10 years honing my skills in Customer Service, Hospitality, Loss Prevention, Crisis Management and most importantly Leadership.
                I learned to look at problems from as many perspectives as possible which gives me the unique advantage of ensuring everyone gets a piece of the pie.
                My experience in Customer Service and Hospitality has taught me how to quickly and accurately find out what an indiviudal needs, and how to go above and beyond to give them a memorable moment.
                My experience in Loss Prevention and Crisis Managament taught me to be scrupulous of the environment around me, watching for events or abnormalites that could cause damage or harm.
                It also taught me how to listen to other attentively, think about information received critically and respond to that information appropriately.
                I learned a pleathora of life saving techniques in cases of emergency and how to effectively communicate between a multitude of different organizations in times of high stress.
                Then finally, my experiences with different types of leaders and then eventually becoming a leader myself, has taught me the value of knowing when to lead and when to listen. 

                There is more to come.
